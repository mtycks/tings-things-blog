    - "When I found these on Amazon, they were listed for $15.99 and also had a $2 off coupon attached to it. At $13.99, this was BY FAR the best deal on a pair of bluetooth headphones I found."
    - "Now, I know that the price I got them for won't last forever&mdash;in fact, at the time of this writing, they're back up to $17.99&mdash;but Amazon is constantly adding coupons to random items so it's worth keeping an eye on this product to see if the price drops again."
    - "Still, at less than $20 it's hard to beat. What really sets these apart from the others is the LCD display in the case that lets you know how much juice you have left."

They claim they're waterproof up to 1 meter deep for 30 minutes!
